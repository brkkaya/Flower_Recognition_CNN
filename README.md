# Flower_Recognition_CNN

Flower Dataset which has 5 different classes.

-First I tried my own model without pre-trained weights. This model get 0.7105 validation accuracy but it is not enough.

Thus, I used pre-trained VGG-19 model to get much more accuracy.

-In pre-trained VGG-19 weights my model get 0.8409 validation accuracy which is a good improvement according to previous model.
